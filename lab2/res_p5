For 20 clusters, and 20 categories, the best r value:

Based on homogeneity:
	NMF: 10
	SVD: 10
Based on completeness:
	NMF: 35
	SVD: 125
Bsed on V-measure:
	NMF: 35
	SVD: 80
Based on RAND:
	NMF: 10
	SVD: 10
Based on Mutual info:	
	NMF: 10
	SVD: 10

SO used r=35 for NMF, and r=80 for SVD


Effects of Scaling and Log transform:

	SVD:	*scaling worsened results for r=80
	
	NMF:	*scaling worsened results
		*Log improved results
		*log then scale improved results the most!
		*scale then log worsened results, but not as bad as just scaling
