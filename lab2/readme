TO RUN

Parts 1-3:
As there are no needed arguments for these parts, and the output is necisary for part 4:

	python 8_cats.py

Part 4:
Using the r-values we chose from part 3 for NMF and SVD reduction (different values were possible):

	python 8_cats_p4.py

Part 5:
A range of r values are cycled through by the script, with the best that we found run for the second part of 5.

	python 20_cats.py
